            <p>Here's what has been on my mind today:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I got my food a whole 2 minutes late today! I thought I was going to starve!</li>
                <li>Defended the yard from the squirrel army once again, I gotta earn my treats somehow right?</li>
                <li>There were so many new smells on my walk today, but I was mostly wondering where those burgers I smelt were!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have so many thoughts and stories that I just couldn't keep them to myself, so I started my own website while my pawrents are at work!</p>
